 At some point in the last 6 months, SOMETHING began making noise from 15m to below 40m at 100khz intervals. It would be on for days, sometimes go out at night, and some times be absent for days at a time. Totally strange. 

I worked with Paul C. at ARRL. We went through every step of the RFI finding process together - checking the house for faults, getting the right equipment, keeping an RFI log, etc. While we initially thought it might have been solar panel noise, it turns out that wasn’t the case.

After a few radio directionfinding sessions, I believe the noise is either coming  from my electric meter (M), or one of two nearby electric poles (P0, P1). 

Care to take a walk with me and see for yourself?

While I actually verified I was tracking the right signal with the waterfall display of my IC705, I found the Eton a fine tool for making a point. 

What do you think, am I on the right track here? What should I do next, talk to PSEG? I need some help verifying the poles are correct. Anyone care to verify their own findings?
